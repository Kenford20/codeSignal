Tournaments are a special mode of CodeSignal where multiple coders can compete vs each other. All participants compete to solve the same set of tasks and the score you get on each task depends on how accurately you solve it. There can be 3 task types in tournaments: Bugfix, Recovery and Codewriting.

Bugfix -- Maximum score: 100. In this type there is one bug in one line of the given code, find and fix it using at most 2 submit attempts.

Recovery -- Maximum score: 100. In this type the highlighted area of the code is missing, and you need to fill it in. You have 3 submit attempts for this type.

Codewriting -- Maximum score: 300. In this type you should understand the requirements of the algorithm and write a function from scratch. The good news is, you have unlimited number of submit attempts!

You can run your code as much as you want before submitting and it will run against sample test cases only. When you actually submit your solution we run it on all tests.

Your score depends on how many tests your program will pass before the first fail. If you pass all tests, you will get the maximum score for that task. Note that sample tests don't award you points, so you need to pass some of the non-sample tests to get a positive score.

In case of equal score the participant with lower time penalty is ranked higher. During tournaments your time penalty is the time of your last score increase. So the user who reached the same score first will be ranked higher.
