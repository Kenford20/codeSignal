// The sine ratio is a useful math tool, commonly used for finding the vertical component of an angled vector. It's defined as the ratio between the opposite side and hypotenuse of a right angle triangle.

// Given an angle theta in degrees, your task is to return sin(theta).

// Example

// For theta = 30, the output should be sine(theta) = 0.5.

function sine(theta) {
    return Math.sin(theta*(Math.PI / 180));
}
