// You have been watching a video for some time. Knowing the total video duration find out what portion of the video you have already watched.

// Example

// For part = "02:20:00" and total = "07:00:00", the output should be
// videoPart(part, total) = [1, 3].

// You have watched 1 / 3 of the whole video.
